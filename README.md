## Blog-Theme

This theme is made to work with Anchor CMS. If you want to try it yourself you can copy the contents to the themes folder in your Anchor setup.
The Theme is based on the standard theme, but I adjusted it slightly.

## Article Images

To add a banner image to an article, you have to add a custom field.
To do this log in to the admin panel and go to Extend > Custom Fields > Create a new Field.

The type must be post, field must be image. The Unique key is article_image, but you can change it in posts.php. You can give it any label you like.
When done, you can upload an image when making/editing an article.
